Hey there! 
Iâ€™m a young student of 22 years old in last year of master in Data Science at EPFL. Initially made in Belgium, I moved to Switzerland in September 2021 in order to finish my master and explore the landscapes.
I am really interested in many topics such as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence or even computer network. But this is not an exhaustive list, I am always hungry to learn and be challenged on any topics (even topics far from bits and electricity).
During my free time I usually do bike (trial and downhill), water sport (Boat, wakeboard, ski, ...) or any sport that keeps me in shape (tennis, rowing, swimming, ...).
