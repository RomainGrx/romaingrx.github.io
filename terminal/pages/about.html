Hey there! 
Iâ€™m a 23 years old engineer who just graduated from a master in data science at EPL/EPFL.     
I am looking for my next challenge in artificial intelligence and more specifically in reinforcement learning, computer vision or AI safety.         
But this is not exhaustive, I am attracted to many fields such as cybersecurity, computer networks, NLP and many others. To tell the truth, I am always hungry to learn and be challenged on any topics (even topics far from bits and electricity).
During my free time I usually do mountain sports (ski, trial bike and downhill bike), water sports (boat, wakeboard, water ski, ...) or any sport that keeps me in shape (tennis, rowing, swimming, ...).
